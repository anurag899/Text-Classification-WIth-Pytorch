"Binders | Over the years, Dow chemists have compiled extensive data confirming that the use of ROPAQUE Opaque Polymer has no adverse effect on the durability of latex paints. In tinted paints, experience has shown that formulations containing ROPAQUE Opaque Polymer exhibit a slight performance advantage in tint retention. Interior Applications The lower levels of TiO 2 and extender in paints containing ROPAQUE Opaque Polymer provide less loose particles available to abrade the paint film. The hydrophobicity of ROPAQUE Opaque Polymer may also help make the paint film less water sensitive. The overall effect improves washability",irrelevant

"Handling and Storage | Contamination Shared transfer lines and other components should be flushed with water before they are used for ROPAQUE Opaque Polymers. Contact with concentrated glycols, surfactants and acid materials, could cause gelling. Compatibility with all new materials should be checked routinely. Filtration and Pumping Exposure of Opaque Polymer to high shear will cause mechanical breakdown and polymer build up. Examples of high shear situations include pumping through small mesh filters at high flow rates and use of pumps with close tolerances. ROPAQUE Opaque Polymers are dilatant products and can blind small pore filters. For off loading, a 400 micron filter should be adequate. When filtering with absorbent elements, pre - wetting the element reduces binding. Cartridge filters and bag filters with needle punched filter bags are examples of filters with absorbent elements. Foam Free fall during unloading should be avoided since it is a prime cause of foam in emulsion products such as ROPAQUE Opaque Polymers. To prevent foaming, storage tanks should be filled from the bottom or through a dip pipe that extends down into the tank below liquid level.",irrelevant

"Description | MAINCOTE™ 1100 A Emulsion is a versatile water based, acrylic copolymer binder for use in industrial maintenance primers, topcoats and direct to metal  ( DTM )  topcoats. MAINCOTE 1100 A Emulsion represents the latest technology from Dow Coating Materials for high performance, low VOC industrial maintenance coatings. It offers formulators a single resin which can be formulated into corrosion - resistant primers, highly durable topcoats, and high gloss DTM finish coats. MAINCOTE 1100 A Emulsion is based on AVANSE™ Technology, incorporates ambient temperature self - crosslinking chemistry and a novel polymer composition. Through a combination of novel technologies, MAINCOTE 1100 A Emulsion facilitates the formulation of high performing coatings at lower Volatile Organic Content  ( VOC )  at or below 100 g/L  ( USA method, water excluded ) . Coatings based on MAINCOTE 1100 A Emulsion offers more efficient pigment spacing resulting in good performance in corrosion resistance, gloss and exterior durability. MAINCOTE 1100 A Emulsion exhibits excellent adhesion to a variety of substrates including metals, concrete and to alkyd painted substrates. Its ambient curing properties make it an excellent candidate to replace solvent borne alkyd paints to facilitate conformance with environmental regulations.",irrelevant
